<h1><b>Bug report guidelines</font></h1>
<br />
<br /><h3>1) This bug tracker is for end-user issues with Blender binaries</h3>
<br /><li>Don't report problems with compiling or building Blender. <a href="http://www.blender.org/community/get-involved/">Check our Get Involved page.</a>
<br />
<br /><h3>2) Is it a Python Add-on?</h3>
<br /><li> Go to the <a href = "http://projects.blender.org/projects/bf-extensions">Python Extension tracker to report it. </a></li>
<br /><h3>3) Is it a real bug?</h3>
<br /><li> Always test with official releases from blender.org. Or get our test builds from <a href="http://builder.blender.org">builder.blender.org</a>.
<br /><li> It has to be intended to work by development. (e.g. not a feature request)
<br /><li> It should be repeatable consistently.
<br /><li> Check on another computer if possible.
<br /><li> Sometimes driver or s/w upgrades cause problems, try a previous release that worked to verify this.
<br /><li> Keep updated with <a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:2.5/Source/Development/Todo">our official todo list</a>.
<br />
<br /><h3>4) Reporting a bug</h3>
<br /><li> Always mention your OS version, 3D card type and Blender version(s) you tested.
<br /><li> Own compiled versions: include svn version number from splash screen. Don't forget to test our official release too.
<br /><li> Essential: ensure others can redo errors by giving exact instructions.
<br /><li> Don't provide long lists of actions, find the minimum amount of instructions showing how to redo it.
